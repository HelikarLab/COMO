    "# COMO: Constraint-based Optomization of Metabolic Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "COMO is used to build computational models that simulate the biochemical and phisiological processes that occur in a cell or organism, known as constraint-based metabolic models. The basic idea behind a constraint-based metabolic model is to use a set of constraints to place boundaries on the system being modeled. These constraints may include (but are not limited to) limits on the availability of nutrients, energy requirements, and the maximum rates of metabolic reactions. COMO imposes these constraints within a specific context. This context includes the cell or tissue type being modeled, along with its disease state. In addition to creating metabolic models, COMO serves as a platform to identify (1) drug targets and (2) repurposable drugs for metabolism-impacting diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline has everything necessary to build a model from any combination of the following sources:\n",
    "- Bulk RNA-seq (total and mRNA)\n",
    "- Single-cell RNA-seq\n",
    "- Proteomics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "COMO does not require programming experience to create models. However, every step of the pipeline is easily accessable to promote modification, addition, or replacement of analysis steps. In addition, this docker container comes pre-loaded with popular R and Python libraries; if you would like to use a library and cannot install it for any reason, please [request it on our GitHub page](https://github.com/HelikarLab/COMO)!\n",

    "A correctly formatted folder named \"COMO inputs\" in the data directory. Proper inputs can be generated using our Snakemake pipeline, [FastqToGeneCounts](https://github.com/HelikarLab/FastqToGeneCounts), which is specifically designed for use with COMO. RNA sequencing data can be single-cell, or bulk, but the provided Snakemake pipeline does not process single-cell data as of now. If you are processing RNA-seq data with an alternate procedure or importing a pre-made gene count matrix, follow the instructions [listed under Step 1](#Importing-a-Pre-Generated-Counts-Matrix)\n",

The sheet names in these configuration files should correspond to the context (tissue name, cell name, etc.). The data in each sheet contains the sample names to include in that context-specific model. These sample names should correspond to the column name in the source data matrix, which will be output (or uploaded, if you have your own data) to `data/data_matrices/MODEL-NAME`\n",

The same will be done for `m0Macro_S2R1` and `m0Macro_S2R2` (John's data). Once these two *separate* lists of active genes have been generated, expression *between* lists will be checked for additional consensus between the studies. This system is used not only to help maintain organization throughout COMO, but because most types of normalized gene counts cannot undergo direct comparisons across replicates. This is especially true for comparisons between different experiments. Therefore, COMO will convert normalized gene counts into a boolean list of active genes. These lists will be compared at the level of replicates in a study, and then again at the level of all provided studies. Finally, the active genes will be merged with the outputs of proteomics and various RNA-sequencing strategies if provided. The rigor used at each level is easily modifiable.\n",

Just like above, `X` is the study number, `Y` is the replicate number, and (if present), `Z` is the run number.

    "This has multiple strategies of library preparation (total, polyA-mRNA). If you are using public data, you may encounter a situation where you would like to use a combination of bulk RNA sequencing data produced using two different library preparation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "COMO currently supports the two most common strategies, mRNA polyA enriched RNA sequencing, and total RNA sequencing. Because of the expected differences in distribution of transcripts, COMO is written to handle each strategy seperately before the integration step. The recommended Snakemake alignment pipeline is designed to work with COMO's preprocessing step ([Step 1, above](Step-1:-Initialize-and-Preprocess-RNA-seq-data)) to split RNA sequencing data from GEO into seperate input matrices and configuration files.\n",

    "While the Snakemake pipeline does not yet support single-cell alignment, and COMO does not yet support automated configuration file and counts matrix file creation for single-cell alignment output from STAR, it is possible to use single-cell data to create a model with COMO. Because normalization strategies can be applied to single-cell data in the same way it is applied to bulk RNA sequencing, `como/rnaseq_gen.py` can be used with a provided counts matrix and configuration file, from [Step 1](Step-1:-Initialize-and-Preprocess-RNA-seq-data), above. Just like `\"total\"` and `\"mRNA\"`, `como/rnaseq_gen.py` can be executed with `\"SC\"` as the \"`--library-prep`\" argument to help COMO differentiate it from any bulk RNA sequencing data if multiple strategies are being used."

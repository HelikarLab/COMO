This pipeline can be found at https://github.com/HelikarLab/FastqToGeneCounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or, **if using your own alignment protocol**, follow this guide to create a `MADRID_inputs` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The top level of the directory has seperate tissues/cells to create seperate models from. The next level must have a folder called `geneCounts` and optionally a `strandedness` folder. If using zFPKM normalization, there should also be two more folders called `layouts` and `fragmentSizes`. Inside each of these folders should be folders named SX (wherer X is an arbitrary user-defined number that replicates are associated with. \n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside these study number folders of `geneCounts` should be outputs of STAR aligner with using --quantMode GeneCounts. To help MADRID (and you!) stay organized, these outputs should be renamed `exampleTissueName_SXRYrZ.tab` where X is the study (or batch) number, Y is the replicate number, and Z is the run number. If the replicate does not contain multiple runs the rZ should be neglected. Replicates should come from the same study/sample group and different samples can come from different published studies (or batches) as long as the tissue/cell was under similar enough conditions for your modeling purpose.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `strandedness` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_strandedness.txt`. These files must tell the strandedness of the the RNA-seq method used, and must contain one of the following text (and nothing else):\n",
    ">> * NONE\n",
    ">> * FIRST_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND\n",
    ">> * SECOND_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `layouts` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_layout.txt` where each file tells the layout of the library used, and must contain one of the following text (and nothing else):\n",
    ">> * paired-end\n",
    ">> * single-end\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `fragmentSizes` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_fragment_sizes.txt` and contain the output of RSeQC's RNA_fragment_size.py function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `prepMethods` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_prep_method.txt` where each file tells the library preparation strategy, which must be one of the following.\n",
    ">> * total\n",
    ">> * mRNA\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "where 'total' refers to Total RNA and mRNA refers to polyA enriched RNA. Note that these strategies serve only to differentiate the methods in the event that both are used to build a model. If a different library strategy is desired, you can use either one as a placeholder, or will very little Python knowledge, it is easy add a new strategy to `merge_xomics.py`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import a properly formatted counts matrix in `/work/data/data_matrices/exampleTissue/gene_counts_matrix_exampleTissue.csv` where the rows are name exampleTissue_SXRY (note the lack of run number since runs should be summed into a single set of counts). **If providing the count matrix this way, instead of generating one using method 1, you will also have to create a configuration file** that has each sample's name, study/batch number, and if using zFPKM, layout and mean fragment length. **Use the provided template** to help. Once provided, run rnaseq_preprocess.py with the '--provide-matrix' argument. <br><br> ***This method is best if you are downloading a premade count matrix, or using single-cell data that has already been batch corrected, clustered, and sorted into only the cell type of interest!**"

Replicates are compared for consensus within the study/batch number according to user-defined ratios and then study/batch numbers are checked for consensus according to different user defined ratios. **Recomended if user wants more control over the size of the model, like a smaller model that allows for only the most expressed reactions, or a larger more encompassing one that contains less essential reactions.\n",

    "> - zFPKM method outlined in: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215113/ can be used. Counts will be normalized using zFPKM and genes > -3 will be considered expressed per thier recommendation. Expressed genes will be checked for consensus at the replicate and study/batch levels the same as TPM Quantile. **Recommended if user wants to give least input over gene essentially determination and use the most standardized method of active gene determination. \n",

    "In the config_sheets folder, there should be a folder called \"disease\". You can add a spreadsheet for each cell/tissue type called `disease_data_inputs_<tissue_name>`. Each sheet of this file should correspond to a seperate disease to analyze using DGE nfor that tissue. The source data can be either microarray or bulk RNA-seq and is formatted the same as if creating the base tissue model. The sheet names should contain the disease name, an underscore, and than either \"microarray\" or \"bulk\" depending on the source data. For example, if the disease is lupus, and the source data is bulk RNA-seq, the name of the sheet should be \"lupus_bulk\". This can be seen in the example sheet. If using bulk RNA-seq data, there should be a count matrix file in `/work/data/data_matrices/<tissue_name>/disease/` called `BulkRNAseqDataMatrix_<disease name>_<tissue name>`. "

This pipeline can be found at https://github.com/HelikarLab/FastqToGeneCounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or, **if using your own alignment protocol**, follow this guide to create a `MADRID_inputs` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The top level of the directory has seperate tissues/cells to create seperate models from. The next level must have a folder called `geneCounts` and optionally a `strandedness` folder. If using zFPKM normalization, there should also be two more folders called `layouts` and `fragmentSizes`. Inside each of these folders should be folders named SX (wherer X is an arbitrary user-defined number that replicates are associated with. \n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside these study number folders of `geneCounts` should be outputs of STAR aligner with using --quantMode GeneCounts. To help MADRID (and you!) stay organized, these outputs should be renamed `exampleTissueName_SXRYrZ.tab` where X is the study (or batch) number, Y is the replicate number, and Z is the run number. If the replicate does not contain multiple runs the rZ should be neglected. Replicates should come from the same study/sample group and different samples can come from different published studies (or batches) as long as the tissue/cell was under similar enough conditions for your modeling purpose.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    ">> * NONE\n",
    ">> * FIRST_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND\n",
    ">> * SECOND_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND\n",
    "<br>\n",

    ">> * paired-end\n",
    ">> * single-end\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `fragmentSizes` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_fragment_sizes.txt` and contain the output of RSeQC's RNA_fragment_size.py function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Inside the study number folders of `prepMethods` should be files named `exampleTissue_SXRYrZ_prep_method.txt` where each file tells the library preparation strategy, which must be one of the following.\n",
    ">> * total\n",
    ">> * mRNA\n",

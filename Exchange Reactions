Lower bound: Uptake of nutrients
	- "-1" = 1 mmol/hour
Upper bound: Secretion of nutrients
Forward or Reverse direction (reverse only for reversible directions)


For basal metabolites, set -1000/1000 lower/upper bounds
Glucose is primary carbon source when proliferating
All amino acids are required
	- Tight constraints: not in abundance in the body, residues can act as limiting factor
	- Set lower bound as -1 to limit uptake
Fatty Acids
	- Make lower bound 0 if I am positive NK cell does not uptake
